  <strong> STEP 1</strong>
Lightly whisk 2 large eggs, 6 tbsp single cream or full cream milk and a pinch of salt together until the mixture has just one consistency.

<p><strong> STEP 2</strong>
Heat a small non-stick frying pan for a minute or so, then add a knob of butter and let it melt. Donâ€™t allow the butter to brown or it will discolour the eggs.
</p>
<p>
<strong> STEP 3</strong>
Pour in the egg mixture and let it sit, without stirring, for 20 seconds. Stir with a wooden spoon, lifting and folding it over from the bottom of the pan.
</p>
<p>
<strong> STEP 4</strong>
Let it sit for another 10 seconds then stir and fold again.
</p>
<p>
<strong> STEP 5</strong>
Repeat until the eggs are softly set and slightly runny in places. Remove from the heat and leave for a moment to finish cooking.
</p>
<strong> STEP 6</strong>
Give a final stir and serve the velvety scramble without delay.
